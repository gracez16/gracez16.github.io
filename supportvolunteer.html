  <h1>Volunteer and Internship Opportunities</h1>
  <p>At ABC, volunteers are treasured allies who assist early childhood teachers in their work with infants, 
    toddlers and preschoolers.</p>
  <p>ABC's five early childhood programs work alongside youth services staff to establish one-on-one mentoring relationships with school-aged children in ABC's afterschool programs. ABC also opens its doors to families on Saturdays during the school year and on Wednesday evenings during the summer with educational programs for parents and recreational activities for children along with hot meals. Volunteers are especially critical to the success of both.<p>
